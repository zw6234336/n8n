Initializing n8n process
n8n ready on ::, port 5678

There are deprecations related to your environment variables. Please take the recommended actions to update your configuration:
 - DB_TYPE -> MySQL and MariaDB are deprecated. Please migrate to PostgreSQL.
 - N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED -> Running n8n without task runners is deprecated. Task runners will be turned on by default in a future version. Please set `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` to enable task runners now and avoid potential issues in the future. Learn more: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/
